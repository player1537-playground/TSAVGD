* There are 3 programs:
** linux-init.sh
*** To run this program, go to the top-level directory of TSAVGD and type:
    source scripts/linux-init.sh
*** This program sets your path variable so it's easier to run the commands
** linux-compile.sh
*** To run: cd into a directory that has source code in it, such as:
    cd Engine/src/event/
*** Then to compile all the code in the current directory do:
    linux-compile.sh
** linux-run.sh
*** To run: cd into the Engine/ directory, like:
    cd Engine/
*** Then to run a class type `linux-run.sh packagename.ClassName`, for instance:
    linux-run.sh event.EventTest
