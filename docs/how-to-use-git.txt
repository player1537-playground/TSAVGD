* How to use git
** 1) Firstly, to get all the code, do:
   git clone https://github.com/player1537/TSAVGD.git
   cd TSAVGD
** 2) At this point, you will probably need to change remote/origin.  You can do this by saying:
   $EDITOR .git/config
   # Change the line that says
   url = https://github.com/player1537/TSAVGD.git
   # to:
   url = https://YOURUSERNAME@github.com/player1537/TSAVGD.git
   # Making sure to change YOURUSERNAME to whatever your github username is, and don't forget the @ sign
   # Then save the file and exit your editor
** 3) From here, you can start making changes to the source code
*** If you only changed existing files, then you just need to do these commands:
    git commit -m 'Your commit message here'
    # Change the message to something relevent to what you changed
    git push origin master
    # Then type your github password
*** If you added some files, it gets a little trickier
**** If you created a new directory and added files in it, then just say:
     git add path/to/my/directory/*
**** If you added files to an existing directory:
     git add path/to/dir/*
**** For both of those, you'll have to go back and commit/push your code (from above)
*** If you removed some files, it's even more annoying
    # You'll probably have to get those files back (next section)
    # Then you need to use git to remove them, like:
    git rm path/to/file.ext
    # Or if it's a full directory:
    git rm path/to/dir
    # `git rm` works the same as `rm` in Linux
*** If you accidentally changed some files and need to revert them
    # Go ahead and remove that file you were working on
    rm path/to/file.ext
    # Note: not using `git` here.
    # Then we need to get it back
    git checkout path/to/file.ext
    # Or if you're lazy (That's me!)
    git checkout path/
** 4) You'll probably need to update your code every so often, this can be done by:
   git pull origin master
** 4a) But, if you changed some files that haven't been changed in the latest commit, you'll need to:
   git checkout path/to/file.ext (like above)
